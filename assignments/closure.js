// ==== Challenge 1: Write your own closure ====
// Write a closure of your own creation.
// Keep it simple! Remember a closure is just a function
// that manipulates variables defined in the outer scope.
// The outer scope can be a parent function, or the top level of the script.

// difference between function test() and const test = function() **********

function helloWorld() {
	const phrase = 'Hello World!';
	function smallHelloWorld() {
		console.log(phrase);
	}
	smallHelloWorld();
}

helloWorld();

// so you dont need to pass in an argument into small function?
// and you need to call small function in bigger function?
// in for loop, i = 0 or let i = 0?

/* STRETCH PROBLEMS, Do not attempt until you have completed all previous tasks for today's project files */


// ==== Challenge 2: Implement a "counter maker" function ====
const counterMaker = () => {
  // IMPLEMENTATION OF counterMaker:
  // 1- Declare a `count` variable with a value of 0. We will be mutating it, so declare it using `let`!
  // 2- Declare a function `counter`. It should increment and return `count`.
  //      NOTE: This `counter` function, being nested inside `counterMaker`,
  //      "closes over" the `count` variable. It can "see" it in the parent scope!
  // 3- Return the `counter` function.
};
// Example usage: const myCounter = counterMaker();
// myCounter(); // 1
// myCounter(); // 2

// ==== Challenge 3: Make `counterMaker` more sophisticated ====
// It should have a `limit` parameter. Any counters we make with `counterMaker`
// will refuse to go over the limit, and start back at 1.

// ==== Challenge 4: Create a counter function with an object that can increment and decrement ====
const counterFactory = () => {
  // Return an object that has two methods called `increment` and `decrement`.
  // `increment` should increment a counter variable in closure scope and return it.
  // `decrement` should decrement the counter variable and return it.
};
